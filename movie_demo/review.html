            <h2>Review of Movie <em>The Batman</em>(2022)</h2>

            <p><b>Derek Rivard</b>,<i>february 5, 2024</i></p>

            <p>For me, <em>The Batman</em> was a personal favorite in my opinion becuase of not only the cast but the brilliant story lines as well as events incoporated by Christopher Reaves throughout. being able to encapture my attention as solidly as <em>The Batman</em> did was quite impressive to me, I couldn't wait until the next time I would be able to see it. Bruce Wayne is thrust into the city that loves to hate him, since he was last seen the corruption within the city seems to be the biggest problem as political brides, heavy drug use, kiddnapping and murder are a mainstay. This brings one of the biggest enemy batmans ever faced, one that uses the citys weakness and plays on it.</p>

                <h3>Trivia About <em>The Batman</em></h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Matt Reeves stated that his version of the Riddler was partly inspired by the infamous Zodiac Killer, an unidentified serial killer who operated in northern California in the late 1960s. The Zodiac used ciphers in his infamous letters to the police, which made Reeves call him a "real-life" Riddler. In the film, Riddler begins his video saying, "This is the Riddler speaking," and the Zodiac began his letters with "This is the Zodiac speaking." The Zodiac also murdered his victims while wearing a leather suit and mask with glasses over the mask, just like the Riddler wears.</li>
                    <li>Colin Farrell stated that he went to Starbucks to try out his prosthetics and makeup for the Penguin for the first time. Nobody recognized him, but he got a couple of stares from people.</li>
                    <li>Robert Pattinson revealed while auditioning for the role, he sneakily took a selfie in the batsuit as a memento "just in case it didn't work out."</li>
